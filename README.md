## Iso-Challenge

### Overview:

- Iso-Challenge is an application intended for validating useless sports knowledge. On load the user will choose a team name and skill level, the user will have a list of current and past NBA players to choose from. The goal is to choose the group of players that produce the best satistics. The players and their stats are fetched form an API, sorted by their position, and displayed for the user to select. Once the teams are chosen you are routed to a score board page that holds the total numbers for each stat for their respective team. From here the user is free to argue with their oppisition all they want on which stats are more valuable.
